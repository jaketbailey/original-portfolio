            <p class="about" style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> I have recently completed my first year studying Software Enginnering at the University of Portsmouth.
                In the first year we have covered a lot of the basics of computer science, ranging from networks to developing
                board games using Javascript, HTML, CSS and Node.js. <br><br>

                This page explains a few of the things that I have been doing at university in first year and what I have learnt.

                                    I the networks module, I learned a lot more than what I had previously in my A-Levels and GCSE. In one of the
                                    courseworks a group of us had to design and present a network based on a mock event similar to the Victiorious music event
                                    that occurs in Southsea yearly. This required us as a team to plan out phsycial and logical designs, calculate the costs 
                                    of all the network equipment and decide what equipment is best for different parts of the site the event was being hosted on. <br><br>

                                    This is something I have never done before until first year, and completing this coursework during the pandemic where
                                    everything we had to do was remote and online was an added difficulty but we still worked together as a team to get the coursework
                                    complete before the deadline to a high standard. <br><br>

                                    I was the team leader for our group on this coursework so I allocate tasks for different members of the group to complete
                                    e.g. Logical Design, Physical Design, Costs etc. To help everyone understand what they were doing and when for, I set up a 
                                    project board using Trello, you can see this <a href="https://trello.com/b/lhQuTLWP/pompfest" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Here</a>.
                                    In order to be the team leader for our group I had to have strong leadership skills, especially as we were working remoteley
                                    in a group where we haven't even met each other. To begin with we had some reoccurring meetings to talk our plans through
                                    and we were always communicating using Discord where we would suggest ideas and offer each other help if and when it was needed. 

                                    We achieved a final grade of 69/100.

                                    At the start of the year I volunteered to be a course representitive for first years studying software engineering.
                                    This entailed me attending several meeting throughout the year to discuss any issues students on my course had raised
                                    with me or any other students. <br><br>

                                    This year, all of the School of Computing's course representitives teamed together to set up a discord server so that 
                                    we could update and offer support to students on our courses. This also allowed all students in the school to speak to any
                                    course rep whether on their course or not so that the message can be passed on the the relevant person if they weren't available there
                                    and then. In creating this server with the other reps, I was approached by a final year software engineering student to be one of the 
                                    server maintenance members on the server so that I had more access to help manage the server when he wasn't around to help both course reps
                                    and the students.<br><br>

                                    The server created a friendly environment for students to discuss any issues they were having, but to also discuss general course relevant information.
                                    Students could ask for advice on coursework etc and any one, student or course rep could help in giving that student some help and advice on the topic.
                                    Having an open platform like this meant that every student would benefit from the server, first year and all the way up to final years. <br><br>

                                    Myself and the other course reps from last year hope to keep this server running next year with the new course reps and I do plan on volunteering
                                    for a second year as course rep.

                                    In application programming we were set two separate pieces of coursework which both were worth 50% of the year's final
                                    grade. The first coursework that was set as the Long Term Coursework, this is the coursework on my projects page where 
                                    we were asked to make a web application which has the game of scrabble. The second piece of coursework was a short term coursework.
                                    In this coursework we were given 3 days to complete a list of tasks using javascript. <br><br>

                                    These tasks got harder as they went along and completing this coursework required a lot of time management skills. I started this coursework
                                    at the time it was given out and finished the same day, however I wanted to ensure that with my knowledge at the time, my programming was 
                                    efficient and accurate to what had been asked. After finishing later in the evening I left the coursework till the next day to go over and 
                                    double check everything. <br><br>

                                    I wanted to ensure that what I had completed was to the best of my ability and reflected my knowledge and skills in programming in
                                    vanilla javascript. I completed the challege tasks on the coursework to the best of my ability and after looking over everything finished
                                    the day after we were given the coursework and when the grades were released I was given a final grade of 88/100. <br><br>

                                    This high grade shows my strength when working under pressure and a short time frame to complete the task at hand. I believe that having learnt
                                    javascript and node.js during 2020 before joining university in September helped me complete this coursework to such a high standard despite 
                                    the timeframe. I am now preparing for year 2 by learning TypeScript and the C programming language over the summer of 2021 to prepare me for
                                    what lies ahead in year 2.<br><br>
