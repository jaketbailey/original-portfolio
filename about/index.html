                I am an outgoing, approachable, enthusiastic, confident, self-motivated student and employee. I have recently achieved A-level Computer Science, 
                Psychology and Maths. I am currently studying for a BSc(Hons) in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth.

                                    As a committed individual, taking pride in my 100% commitment to any task or interest. 
                                    An example of this is that I have been raising money for charity from a very young age. In 2016, after 2 years of training, 
                                    I cycled from Land’s End in Cornwall to John o’ Groats in Scotland, completing a total of 999 miles in 12 consecutive days. 
                                    I successfully raised £7300 for three individual charities, Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. 
                                    In addition, I set up a blog for the whole event and for the training attracting interest from BBC Midlands Today. 
                                    There have been many other cycle events that I have completed, such as including Birmingham Bikeathon for Leukaemia and 
                                    cycling for men’s cancer when I was 6 years of age, and I have raised money with family in other events, for example, Macmillan Cancer Support.<br><br>
                                    
                                    In 2020 I completed my A-Levels with a set of high grades, which are detailed below. During college, I was nominated and voted for as the 
                                    Students' Union Secretary, demonstrating my leadership, negotiation and teamwork skills.<br><br>
        
                                    In Year 10, I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Level Award, which included volunteer work and doing continuous activity and 
                                    pursuing my further interests. The Award also included several expeditions.<br><br>
        
                                    During the part of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 I volunteered for a local food bank
                                    <a href="https://cannockdistrict.foodbank.org.uk/" style="color: white;"> (Cannock and District Foodbank)</a> to manage and organise orders
                                    to be packed together and ready to be delivered. I would communicate with the delivery drivers, giving them the addresses for each delivery as
                                    well as helping pack the vans to make each delivery. See my interview my previous college made with me last summer

                                    In 2020 I completed my A Levels in Computer Science, Psychology and Maths with my highest grade being an A in Computer Science. I have
                                    since progressed onto my first year of a BSc(Hons) Course in Software Engineering at the University of Portsmouth. I have recently progressed onto
                                    second year at University having passed my first year with an average of 70.75% across modules.
        
                                    In 2018 I completed my GCSEs with a set of very high grades ranging from graded 8-5. Aged 15 I successfully applied for and 
                                    completed a prefect role at my school. In Year 10 I completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Level Award, When involved I committed 
                                    to volunteer work as well as doing a continuous activity and pursuing my interests further. The Award also included an 
                                    expedition as well as two training expeditions where I further developed my team and leadership skills.<br><br>
        
                                    I also have a passion for music where I have achieved up to Grade 4 music theory, grade 3 piano and grade 5 alto saxophone. 
                                    I am currently working towards grade 6 on the alto saxophone which I hope to complete after my A-Levels have finished.
