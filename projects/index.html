                                    For 50% of our Application Programming module for year 1 of my Software Engineering degree we were asked to make a
                                    game of scrabble using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For this coursework I decided to go above and beyond with my project, enabling
                                    the user to play online multiplayer using lobbys to connect to each others game rather than just making a single player
                                    local game. I have managed to program a working online multiplayer game of scrabble using websockets to allow the multiplayer lobbies
                                    to function. If you wish to see the game you can play

                                    This small project I decided to make quickly to essentially help me keep up to date with my webserver.
                                    My webserver hosts this website, my sister's and I have another webserver hosting my scrabble game. This small
                                    Node application can be ran on a server and will essentially keep pinging a specific ip address and if the HTTP code returns anything
                                    other than 200 OK, I will receive a text message using the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" style="color: white">Twilio API</a> updating me of the situation so that I know to go and check my webserver to figure out
                                    what the issue is. The code is viewable on my <a href="https://github.com/JakeMeistet/status-check" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Github</a>

                                    This is a small scale project from when I was initially tinkering with Node.JS in 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
                                    It is a very simple command line style FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client. I have based interaction with the client
                                    from bash using commands like cd to navigate directories etc. I have plans to continue on with this project. But for now it
                                    can connect with an FTP server using the details the user can input. It also has support for TLS/SSL encryption and for FTP
                                    servers hosted on different ports. It can also currently navigate through directories. All the code for the project is viewable on my

                                    This is the website you are currently on. I started making this portfolio website from scratch
                                    in 2020 as previously I had used a website maker e.g. Wix Editor to make my website. As I has more time
                                    during the lockdown in 2020, I chose to make this website from scratch and host it all myself. 
                                    In making the website it allowed me to extend my skills coding in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js.
                                    Since making the original website I have updated it multiple times and I am always trying to make it better
                                    every time. I use this for all my projects, contact details as well as an online CV. The homepage is

                                    online CV, any updates she needs to the website I will add and manage. I will also add any of her current

                                    For my A Level coursework I created a cycling tracker windows forms program using VisualBasic.NET The charity bike ride I completed 
                                    in 2016 was the inspiration for this program. The system that I made aimed to act as a client version of current systems such as strava.com. 
                                    The system was designed to allow the user to enter all their past bike ride data which can then be compared against itself and other user's data. 
                                    If I had more time on this project I would have stored all the information on an external database rather than within text files on the user's 
                                    computer. The time limitation meant that the comparisons with other users was quite limited and every time the user was on a new computer their 
                                    information would have to be re-entered into the system. If this was a larger scale project then the larger aims could've been accomplished. 
                                    I have achieved a provisional grade A* for this project, and the code can be found on my

                                    In 2016 I cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for charity. I raised a total of £7,300 which was then split between 3 charities: 
                                    Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. I trained for this bike ride weekly for over a year. 
                                    During the training process, we met up with <a href="https://markbeaumontonline.com/" target="_blank" style="color: white"> Mark Beaumont </a> who gave us advice 
                                    on what equipment to use for the bike ride as well as different training strategies to use when approaching the ride. 
                                    I also attracted the attention of the BBC's David Lumb who reported on my Dad and I which was later broadcast on BBC Midland's Today. 
                                    I also got an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live where we discussed the charity cycle and some of our tips from our training experience.
