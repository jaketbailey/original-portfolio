                                    For 50% of our Application Programming module for year 1 of my Software Engineering degree we were asked to make a
                                    game of scrabble using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For this coursework I decided to go above and beyond with my project, enabling
                                    the user to play online multiplayer using lobbys to connect to each others game. Despite the game being slightly buggy if someone leaves the
                                    lobby and some word detection doesn't always work, on the general I have managed to get a functional online multiplayer game of scrabble.
                                    I have tested this game on multiple devices, so it was a shame to see it didn't work when it came to the lecturers marking. If you wish to see this game working you can play 
                                    <a href="https://scrabble.jaketbailey.co.uk" style="color: white;">here</a> and all the code for the project is viewable on my

                                    For my A Level coursework I created a cycling tracker windows forms program using VisualBasic.NET The charity bike ride I completed 
                                    in 2016 was the inspiration for this program. The system that I made aimed to act as a client version of current systems such as strava.com. 
                                    The system was designed to allow the user to enter all their past bike ride data which can then be compared against itself and other user's data. 
                                    If I had more time on this project I would have stored all the information on an external database rather than within text files on the user's 
                                    computer. The time limitation meant that the comparisons with other users was quite limited and every time the user was on a new computer their 
                                    information would have to be re-entered into the system. If this was a larger scale project then the larger aims could've been accomplished. 
                                    I have achieved a provisional grade A* for this project, and the code can be found on my

                                    In 2016 I cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for charity. I raised a total of £7,300 which was then split between 3 charities: 
                                    Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK, Birmingham Children's Hospital and Sandwell Young Carers. I trained for this bike ride weekly for over a year. 
                                    During the training process, we met up with Mark Beaumont (markbeaumontonline.com/) who gave us advice on what equipment to use for the bike ride 
                                    as well as different training strategies to use when approaching the ride. I also attracted the attention of the BBC's David Lumb who reported on 
                                    my Dad and I which was later broadcast on BBC Midland's Today. I also got an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live where we discussed the charity cycle 
                                    and some of our tips from our training experience.
